    There are certain considerations or factors that everyone takes into account in a
    relationship. People may look for honesty, altruism, understanding, loyalty, being
    thoughtful etc! Everyone would more or less wish that the person s/he is dealing
    with, has some of these virtues above. Putting them in an order according to their
    importance, however can be very subjective and relative.
  </p>
  <p>
    When someone asks him/herself the question “What do I consider to be the
    most important thing in my relationship?” the answer depends on a lot of factors
    such as how his/her earlier relationships were.
  </p>
  <p>
    After stating that everyone’s opinion can be different about this, for me honesty, in other words, always telling the truth is the most important consideration
    in a relationship. Opposite of this is inarguably lying and if someone needs to lie,
    either s/he is hiding something or is afraid of telling me something.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any relationship of mine, I would wish that ﬁrst of all, the person I’m dealing with is honest. Even though s/he thinks that s/he did something wrong that I
    wouldn’t like, s/he’d better tell me the truth and not lie about it. Later on if I ﬁnd out
    about a lie or hear the truth from someone else, that’d be much more unpleasant. In
    that case how can I ever believe or trust that person again? How can I ever believe
    that this person has enough conﬁdence in me to forgive him/her and carry on with
    the relationship from there. So if I cannot trust a person anymore, if the person
    doesn’t think I can handle the truth, there’s no point to continuing that relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I would like to see altruistic, understanding, thoughtful and loyal behavior from people, an instance of the opposite of these behaviors would not
    upset me as much as dishonesty would. Among all the possible behaviors, dishonesty is the only one for me that terminates how I feel about a person’s reliability.
    Therefore honesty would be my ﬁrst concern and the most important consideration
    in a relationship.
  </p>

    Rater Comments:
    In this response the writer first approaches the topic by underscoring that a
    number of character traits are important to a relationship. The writer then effectively develops an argument that, unlike other negative behaviors, dishonesty or
    unwillingness to fully disclose some bad action cannot be forgiven and can be
    the most important factor in destroying a relationship. The writer’s language is
    ﬂuent, accurate, and varied enough to effectively support the progression and
    connection of ideas. There is a variety of sentence structures, including rhetorical
    questions. The essay is not mechanically perfect, but as long as such errors are
    occasional, are minor, and do not interfere with the reader’s understanding, an
    essay like this one can still earn a top score.

    Always telling the truth in any relationship is really the most important consideration for many reasons. I could say that when you lie to someone, this person will
    not trust you anymore and what is a relationship based on? Trust, conﬁdence, so
    the sense of relationship is being lost. Another point is that if the true is ommited
    once, it will surely appear sometime, somewhere and probably in the most unexpected way, causing lots of problems for the ones involved. So, the truth is the
    basis for everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, conﬁdence is the most important aspect of a friendship or a marriage, or
    anything like that, so, once it is lost, the whole thing goes down in a way that no
    one can bear it. To avoid losing conﬁdence, there is only one way, telling the truth,
    lying will just help throwing it away. For example, a couple decided to go out on
    the weekend, but the man has a party to go with his friends to where he can not
    take his girlfriend and then he lies to her saying that he is sick and can not go to the
    date. She undertands him and they do not see each other in that weekend, but he
    goes to the party and has much fun. Suppose on monday, the girl talks to a friend
    that saw him at the party and asked why did not she go with him. She found out
    the true and all conﬁdence was lost, the basis for their relation is now gone and
    what happens next is that they break up or if they do not, he will persist on lyes and
    someday it will end.
  </p>
  <p>
    What happened to this couple is very common around here and many relationships, even friends and marriages end because of something like that. Some
    may argue that lying once or another will not interfere anything and it is part of a
    relation, but I strongly disagree, the most important thing is the true, even if it is to
    determine the end of a relation, it must be told. There are more chances to end
    something lying than saying what really happened

    This essay earned a score of 4. It clearly develops reasons why lying is a bad
    thing, with a ﬁrst paragraph that introduces the writer’s position (“truth is the
    basis for everything”), a hypothetical story in paragraph 2, and a ﬁnal paragraph that entertains and quickly dismisses a possible counterargument. All this
    amounts to solid development of the idea. The response displays facility in language use through a variety of sentence structures and the use of clear transitions
    between sentences. However, sometimes the writer’s sentences include noticeable
    errors in word form (“if the true is ommited,” “lying will just help throwing it
    away,” “persist on lyes,” “lying once or another” ), and in some places the writer
    extends, or “runs on,” a sentence to include many steps in the argument when
    using two or more sentences would make the relationships between ideas clearer.
    For example, “Some may argue that lying once or another will not interfere anything and it is part of a relation, but I strongly disagree, the most important thing
    is the true, even if it is to determine the end of a relation, it must be told.”

    Some people believe that it is one of the most important value in many relationships
    to tell the truth all the time. However, it cannot be always the best choice to tell the
    truth in many situatioins. Sometimes white lies are indispensible to keep relationships more lively and dilightly. There are some examples to support this idea.
  <p>  
    Firstly, in the relationships between lovers, it is often essential to compliment
    their lovers on their appearance and their behavior. Even though they do not think
    that their boyfriend or girlfriend looks good on their new shoes and new clothes, it
    will probably diss them by telling the truth. On the other hand, little compliments
    will make them conﬁdent and happy making their relationship more tight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, parents need to encourage their children by telling lies. Even if they
    are doing bad work on studying or exercising, telling the truth will hurt their hearts.
    What they need is a little encouraging words instead of truthful words.
    Thirdly, for some patients telling them their current state of their desease will
    probably desperate them. It is accepted publically not to let the patients know the
    truth. They may be able to have hope to overcome their desease without knowing
    the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, it is not always better to tell the truth than lies. Some lies are
    acceptable in terms of making people’s life more profusely. Not everybody has to
    know the truth, and it will lead them more happier not knowing it. In these cases,
    white lies are worth to be regarded as a virtue of people’s relationships
  </p>
  <p>
    This essay focuses on explaining why “white lies” are sometimes appropriate. The
    explanations here are somewhat developed. Each example does support the main
    point; however, at critical junctures in the writer’s attempt to explain why the
    positive effect of the white lie outweighs any negative effect, inconsistent facility
    with language hinders the writer’s effort. So, with errors in both structure and vocabulary that obscure meaning (“keep relationships . . . dilightly,” “will probably desperate them,” “making people’s life more profusely,” “it will lead them
    more happier not knowing it”), this essay earns a score of 3.

    Recently, there is a big debate on the issue that telling the truth or not is the most
    important consideration in the relationship between people. For my experience, I
    think telling a truth is the most important consideration in people’s relationship. In
    the following, I will illustrate my opinion by two reasons.
  <p>  
    First of all, honest make the trust stronger between friends or colleages. As we
    know, if people tell a lie to others he will not be trusted. When he tell a truth, others
    will believe that he tells a lie. For example, a person who is honest to others, can
    get real help and get trust of others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, telling a lie always makes things worse not only in work but also in
    family life. When somebody do something wrong in his job he should annouce his
    mistake to his manager. If he don’t do that others may continue their jobs base on
    the mistake. Consequently, the work will be worse and worse.
    On the contrary, sometimes it is better to tell a lie to others, such as telling a lie
    to a patient. As we know, the sick become worse when a cancer patient know his
    illness. A good way to protect their life is to tell a lie. So that many doctors will not
    tell the truth to a dying patient.
  </p>
  <p>
    To sum up, people should tell the truth to maintain their relationship with other
    people, although sometimes people have to tell a lie. People can get trust when
    they are honest to others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rater comments: This essay is quite long, but even though it uses several examples, each idea is
    only partly developed, and the connections among ideas are weak or contradictory. For instance, in paragraph 2 the ﬁrst sentence says, “honest make the trust
    stronger.” The next two sentences present a contrast: “if people tell a lie to others
    he will not be trusted”; then “when he tell a truth, others will believe that he tells
    a lie.” Then the last sentence in the paragraph says, “For example, a person who
    is honest to others, can get real help and get trust of others.” But that is not an
    example of the previous sentence and only confuses the reader. This last sentence
    does not advance the progression of ideas much beyond the ﬁrst sentence and
    certainly is not an example of the point made by the second and third sentences.
    Thus connections throughout this paragraph are tenuous. Paragraph 3 begins
    by saying that telling a lie makes things worse at work and at home, but it does
    not follow through at all on the latter. The “On the contrary” paragraph comes
    as a surprise to the reader, since paragraph 1 said that the writer was going to
    give two reasons why telling the truth was the most important consideration in
    human relationships. Because of all these weaknesses, this essay earns a score
    of 2.

    Nowadays, many people think that the people who always telling the true is the
    most inportant consideration in any relationship between human. but another think
    that is necessary to tell some lies. It is seldom to reach the same issue.I agree with
    the ﬁrst thinking because of the following reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    First fo all, we all live in the realized world , people can respect you unless you
    want to use correct method to communicate with other people. It is very important,
    especially in business , if you want to recieve the good resulit ,you must tell the ture
    about your own so that gain the considement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, if you are honest man/woman, many people may be want to make
    friend with you. You can have more chance to communate with other people . you
    may be gain more information from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    However,sometimes we must speak some lie.for examlpe, when our relatives
    have heavy illness such as cancer,we couldn’t telling them the ture. because that
    not good for their health,and may be affect their life.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion,tellingthe ture is the people good behavire .we must require most
    of people to tell the ture.thus,we can see the better world in our life unless we
    always tell the ture.
  </p>

    Rater Comments: This essay contains serious and frequent errors in sentence structure and usage.
    Paragraph 2, beginning “First fo all,” is nearly incomprehensible and contains
    vocabulary that is either vague at best or nonstandard English (“realized world,”
    “considement”). Paragraph 3 is completely vague, and paragraph 4 (actually one
    sentence), though it mentions a familiar example, is poorly expressed and certainly underdeveloped. For all these reasons, this essay earns a score of 1.
